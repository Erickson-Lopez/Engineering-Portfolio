## 1. Project Introduction

Brief overview of project goals, what the tank does, and why it was built. (To be expanded with more detail later.)

## 2. Mechanical Systems & Design

- **Chassis & Frame:**  
  3D-printed PLA/PETG chassis, FEA-validated for strength.  
  All major load-bearing mounts analyzed in ANSYS (factor of safety ‚â• 3).

- **Turret & Launcher:**  
  Pan/tilt with standard and continuous servos, sprocket-driven launcher for rapid fire.

- **Track Drive:**  
  Dual N20 motors (ESC-controlled), 4cm sprocket drive wheels for pivot and turn capability.

- **FEA & Validation:**  
  Static structural simulation (ANSYS 2025R2) on critical parts.  
  Max deformation ‚â§ 0.2mm; von-Mises stress well below PLA yield.  
  [Downloadable simulation files and viewers available.]

- **Manufacturing & Design Choices:**  
  Designed around FDM 3D printing for easy replication and modification. Fasteners chosen for plastic (M3 screws, heat inserts).  
  Design driven by balance between ease of printing, strength, and modularity.

- **Speed Calculation (at 1000 RPM):**  
  - Sprocket diameter: 4 cm  
  - Circumference: ‚âà 0.126 m  
  - RPS: ‚âà 16.67  
  - Linear speed: ‚âà 2.10 m/s (~7.56 km/h) at no load
