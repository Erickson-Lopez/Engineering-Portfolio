# Hey, I’m Erickson 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a second year Mechanical engineering student who’s all about hands-on building, simple solutions, and making stuff that’s actually helpful. Scroll down to see my work and what I’m currently building.

## My Engineering Philosophy

### Keeping it Simple, Creative, and Hands-On

I’m a big believer that the best engineering is simple. If you can make something less complicated, why not? To me, simple designs and processes aren’t about cutting corners—they just work better, are easier to fix, and let you test ideas faster. I always try to solve problems with the least amount of extra work, not because I’m lazy, but because it means I can spend more time making improvements and less time fighting with my own designs.

Helping people in everyday life is what gets me excited to build stuff. I want what I make to be genuinely useful. I’m always curious about how things work, and I love experimenting with new ideas—even if they’re a little out there. Whether I’m designing in CAD, working on small engines/vehicles, or messing around with my 3D printer, I just love creating tangible things.

Since I was a kid, I’ve been tearing apart RC cars and planes just to see how they tick, then putting them back together (sometimes with “improvements”). That curiosity is still what drives me as an engineering student. When I run into a problem, I like to get to the root cause first—fix the big thing, then handle the smaller stuff step by step. Breaking projects into chunks just makes everything more manageable.

I pick up a lot from other people too. If I see a cool trick or hack online, I’ll figure out the core idea and try it myself. I’m always looking for practical ideas to add to my own toolkit, but I still think for myself and try to find my own twist on things (like using staples for tread hinges!)

At the end of the day, I want to make stuff I’d actually use or buy myself. I’ve seen a ton of products that miss the mark for real users, and I never want to be that kind of engineer. For me, success is about building things that solve real problems, and being as hands-on as possible—because I learn best by doing, not just by sitting at a desk.

### 110cc ATV Frame Rework [IN PROGRESS]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erickson-Lopez/Engineering-Portfolio/5ff9ce760a15c3b2cbd4ceb4896162287b793aea/assets/README/IMG_2159.jpeg" alt="Project Image" width="400"/>

After a failed go kart project I found myself stuck with a perfectly good atv engine; a Chinese made electric start 125cc 4 stroke with a 3 speed, neutral and reverse semi auto transmission. A mouthfull I know. In due time I stumbled across a $40 110cc size ATV frame on Facebook marketplace that would end up being the best $40 I've spent to date. Unfortunately $40 doesn't get you a new chassis, so mine came with issues and flat tires. The frame had sustained wear around the engine mount closest to the motor sprocket and started to detach at the welds. Likely due to the rotational torque from the chain. The steering kuckles were very worn, to fix this washers were welded on as reinforcement. As far as compatibility most of these horizontal engines, ranging from 50cc-125cc, are the same bolt patterns since the only changes in design are: the transmission internals and the displacement of the head. This meant I could bolt up the engine onto the frame with zero modifications, and have more power than I should need from a slightly higher displacement engine. To this day it runs well with the occassional hiccup with carb and wiring issues. Nonetheless, I hope to do some cool (possibly arduino based) modifications with this... less than adequate, mini-vehicle.

#### Updates Feed:
- **2025-03-25** — 110cc ATV frame acquired.
- **2025-08-19** — Welds fixed alongside steering knuckle reinforcement.   
- **2025-08-20** — Foot pegs lowered and welded with splints for reinforcement, can adequately say the frame will come apart before my less than ideal welds fail. This modification allows larger riders to ride more comfortably, as well as easier gear shifting. Cons: old 110cc tao tao plastic bodies wil no longer fit on it, fine considering I have... other plans for the frame.
- **2025-08-29** — Base bodywork materials acquired, pink Jeep anyone? Heck yeah! 🗣️.
