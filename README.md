# Hey, I’m Erickson 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a second year Mechanical engineering student who’s all about hands-on building, simple solutions, and making stuff that’s actually helpful. Scroll down to see my work and what I’m currently building.

## My Engineering Philosophy

### Keeping it Simple, Creative, and Hands-On

I’m a big believer that the best engineering is simple. If you can make something less complicated, why not? To me, simple designs and processes aren’t about cutting corners—they just work better, are easier to fix, and let you test ideas faster. I always try to solve problems with the least amount of extra work, not because I’m lazy, but because it means I can spend more time making improvements and less time fighting with my own designs.

Helping people in everyday life is what gets me excited to build stuff. I want what I make to be genuinely useful. I’m always curious about how things work, and I love experimenting with new ideas—even if they’re a little out there. Whether I’m designing in CAD, working on small engines/vehicles, or messing around with my 3D printer, I just love creating tangible things.

Since I was a kid, I’ve been tearing apart RC cars and planes just to see how they tick, then putting them back together (sometimes with “improvements”). That curiosity is still what drives me as an engineering student. When I run into a problem, I like to get to the root cause first—fix the big thing, then handle the smaller stuff step by step. Breaking projects into chunks just makes everything more manageable.

I pick up a lot from other people too. If I see a cool trick or hack online, I’ll figure out the core idea and try it myself. I’m always looking for practical ideas to add to my own toolkit, but I still think for myself and try to find my own twist on things (like using staples for tread hinges!)

At the end of the day, I want to make stuff I’d actually use or buy myself. I’ve seen a ton of products that miss the mark for real users, and I never want to be that kind of engineer. For me, success is about building things that solve real problems, and being as hands-on as possible—because I learn best by doing, not just by sitting at a desk.
