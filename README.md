# Hey, I’m Erickson 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a second year Mechanical engineering student who’s all about hands-on building, simple solutions, and making stuff that’s actually helpful. Scroll down to see my work and what I’m currently building.

## My Engineering Philosophy

### Keeping it Simple, Creative, and Hands-On

I’m a big believer that the best engineering is simple. If you can make something less complicated, why not? To me, simple designs and processes aren’t about cutting corners; they just work better, are easier to fix, and let you test ideas faster. I always try to solve problems with the least amount of extra work, not because I’m lazy, but because it means I can spend more time making improvements and less time fighting with my own designs.

Helping people in everyday life is what gets me excited to build stuff. I want what I make to be genuinely useful. I’m always curious about how things work. I love experimenting with new ideas, even if they’re a little out there. Whether I’m designing in CAD, working on small engines/vehicles, or messing around with my 3D printer, I just love creating tangible things.

Since I was a kid, I’ve been tearing apart RC cars and planes just to see how they tick, then putting them back together (sometimes with “improvements”). That curiosity is still what drives me as an engineering student. When I run into a problem, I like to get to the root cause first—fix the big thing, then handle the smaller stuff step by step. Breaking projects into chunks just makes everything more manageable.

I pick up a lot from other people too. If I see a cool trick or hack online, I’ll figure out the core idea and try it myself. I’m always looking for practical ideas to add to my own toolkit, but I still think for myself and try to find my own twist on things (like using staples for tread hinges!)

At the end of the day, I want to make stuff I’d actually use or buy myself. I’ve seen a ton of products that miss the mark for real users, and I never want to be that kind of engineer. For me, success is about building things that solve real problems, and being as hands on as possible; because I learn best by doing, not just by sitting at a desk.

### 110cc ATV Frame Rework [IN PROGRESS]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erickson-Lopez/Engineering-Portfolio/5ff9ce760a15c3b2cbd4ceb4896162287b793aea/assets/README/IMG_2159.jpeg" alt="Project Image" width="400"/>  
After a go-kart project fell through, I was left with one silver lining: a perfectly functional Chinese-made 125cc electric start 4-stroke engine, complete with a 3-speed semi-automatic transmission, neutral, and reverse. A mouthful, I know. Eventually, I stumbled across a $40 110cc-sized ATV frame on Facebook Marketplace. It turned out to be the best $40 I’ve spent to date. Of course, $40 doesn’t get you showroom quality. The chassis came with issues: flat tires, worn steering knuckles, and stress fractures at the engine mount closest to the sprocket (ikely from chain torque fatigue.) Some budget-friendly field repairs (washer-weld reinforcement on knuckles and better bracing on motor mounts) brought it back to life. Compatibility wise, most horizontal Chinese ATV engines between 50cc and 125cc share the same bolt pattern. That meant I could drop the engine straight in with zero frame modifications. Thanks to the higher displacement, I got more torque than I probably needed (but hey I'm not complaining.) To this day, the thing still runs. It’s not flawless (occasional hiccups with the carb or wiring keep me humble) but it’s a great little platform for experimenting. Eventually, I’d love to incorporate some Arduino-based controls or telemetry mods to bring this janky mini-beast into the modern era.

#### Updates Feed:
- **2025-03-25** — 110cc ATV frame acquired.
- **2025-08-19** — Welds fixed alongside steering knuckle reinforcement.   
- **2025-08-20** — Foot pegs lowered and welded with splints for reinforcement, can adequately say the frame will come apart before my less than ideal welds fail. This modification allows larger riders to ride more comfortably, as well as easier gear shifting.
Cons: old 110cc tao tao plastic bodies wil no longer fit on it, fine considering I have... other plans for the frame.
- **2025-08-29** — Base bodywork materials acquired, pink Jeep anyone? Heck yeah! 🗣️.
